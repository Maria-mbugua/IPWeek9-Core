# IMPLEMENTING kNN AND NAIVE BAIYES CLASSIFIER

# a) Specifying the Question

Implementing kNN classifier and Naive Bayes classifier with the following datasets;

# b) Defining the Metrics of success

Performing kNN and Naive Bayes Classification with the dataset.

# c) Understanding the context

Using the kNN and Naive Bayes Classifier in the dataset.

# d) Experimental Design

1. Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design.

2. Read and clean the dataset.

3. Define the appropriate method to answer the question.

4. Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

5. Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis.

6. Partitioning the dataset into 80 - 20 sets.

7. Using the kNN and  Naive Bayes Classifier.

8. Repeat step 6 to step 7 twice, each time splitting the dataset differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40, then note the outcomes of your modeling.

9. Applying an optimization technique.

10. Recommendation for kNN and  Naive Bayes Classifier.
